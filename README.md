<b>MATHEMATICS FOR MACHINE LEARNING</b>
<br></br>
This repository contains code and theory of mathematical concepts required to master Machine Learning.
This repository will give any budding beginner in Machine Learning a solid foundation on the important concepts 
in <b>Linear Algebra</b> and <b>Multivariate Calculus</b>.I have included IPython notebooks which has code snippets and important
explanations.
<br></br>
<b>So, Go ahead, Fork this repo and Happy Machine Learning :)</b>
