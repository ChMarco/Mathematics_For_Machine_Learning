<b>MATHEMATICS FOR MACHINE LEARNING</b>
<br></br>
This repository contains code and theory of mathematical concepts required to master Machine Learning.
This repository will give any budding beginner in Machine Learning a solid foundation on the important concepts 
in <b>Linear Algebra</b> and <b>Multivariate Calculus</b>.I have included IPython notebooks which has code snippets and important
explanations.

-Linear Algebra Intuition:
```python
#Definition of Linear Algebra:

#Ans: Linear Algebra can be defined as the study of vectors,vector spaces and mapping between vector spaces.
#     It emerged from the study of matrices and the knowledge that they can be solved using system of linear equations.

#Use cases of Linear Algebra:

#Ans: 1. Solving of linear equations like:
         2a+3b=10
         7b+5c=20
         The above eqaution can be decomposed into matrices and vectors like:
         [2 3 [a]=[10]
          7 5][b] [20]
#     2. Optimization Problem:
#        Another use can be to fit a line that best matches a data distribution.The objective is to find the 
#        line or curve that best fits the data distribution by finding the optimal parameters of the line.

# Exercise:

#Solve the system of equations given by:

3x−2y+z=7
x+y+z=2
3x−2y−z=3
```

```
